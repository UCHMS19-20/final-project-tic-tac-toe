## Websites We Used

The following links are sites that we used to aid in the creation of our code. 

# Background Surface
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/328061/how-to-make-a-surface-with-a-transparent-background-in-pygame

This site showed us how to create a background surface for our game. It showed an example of how one person did it, and we used this example to model the background surface in ou code.

# Drawing Lines
https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html

This showed us the exact way to draw lines, which we used in the creation of our grid. 

# Show Mouse Position
https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html

This showed us how to show the mouse position, which we used to aid in the player's choice of their spot on the grid.

* The rest of our sources are directly from Pygame.org and this website helped us tremendously in the creation of our game.
